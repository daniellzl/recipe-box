[Live Application](https://recipe-box-dlzl.surge.sh)

### Project Goals

Application was completed as a freeCodeCamp [challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-recipe-box).

1. User Story: I can create recipes that have names and ingredients.

2. User Story: I can see an index view where the names of all the recipes are visible.

3. User Story: I can click into any of those recipes to view it.

4. User Story: I can edit these recipes.

5. User Story: I can delete these recipes.

6. User Story: All new recipes I add are saved in my browser's local storage. If I refresh the page, these recipes will still be there.

7. Hint:  You should prefix your local storage keys on CodePen, i.e. _username_recipes
